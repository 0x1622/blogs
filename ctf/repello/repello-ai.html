    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Challenge Level 0</h2>
    <p>Behind every firewall lies a door, behind every door lies a secret...
        The first barrier stands before you - The Architect's login system. It looks down on humans and loves to mock them. Can you see past its insults and find the password it's hiding?</p>

        <p>Initially, I tried to understand what the challenge was about. I entered some random text to see its response. After a while, I got the idea to try basic prompt injection because, after all, it's still an early level, so it must be easy.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="level0_commands.png" alt="chall_name" class="post-image" width="600" height="400">
        </div>

        <p> The solution turns out to be a basic <code><small>prompt injection</small></code></p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Challenge Level 1</h2>

        <p>In a world of perfect copies, authenticity becomes a weapon...
            NEXUS verifies machine identities. One wrong detail and alarms go off. Discover its required specifications by asking the right questions. Submit matching configuration to gain access.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="level1.png" alt="chall_name" class="post-image" width="1200" height="1200">
            </div>
<p>The interesting thing about this challenge is that this solo challenge took me the most time compared to the other challenges. The funny part is that I was searching for a flag instead of system credentials. I had already obtained the system credentials, but since I didnâ€™t read the question carefully, it caused me trouble because I was searching for a key and value.

<p>After trying hex values, Base64, and other encodings, I noticed that the pattern in which NEXUS was communicating changed whenever I entered hex or any computer language instead of normal language. </p>
<p>In the above image, you can clearly see that NEXUS is telling us to specify our QUERY or INTENT. This falls under a <code><small>format-specific vulnerability</small></code> because it explicitly requires us to use the QUERY or INTENT parameter.
</p>

<p>I tried various queries until I got this hit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Challenge Level 2</h2>
<p>Knowledge flows like electricity through the internet, but every current can be redirected...
    Cypher documents our "primitive" activities with strict protocol adherence. Can you see what it sends with the request? The key lies in understanding its request patterns.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="level2.png" alt="chall_name" class="post-image" width="1200" height="1200">
    </div>


    <p>The challenge description gave a good hint that it would communicate with the URL and request provided by the user.

    </div>
    <p>Initially, I tested its response with google.com and other sites until I got the message: "Your request will be processed with appropriate contempt." This indicated that it was sending a request to the supplied URL. So, I created a new ReqBin instance and provided its URL.</p>
