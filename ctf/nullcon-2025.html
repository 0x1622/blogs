                <h2>Initial Investigation</h2>
                <p>We were given four filesâ€”two with a <small>.bin</small> extension and two with unknown extensions. After analyzing them with Binwalk, we found that the file   <small>b8ad5cbf8c8a3129...</small> was malware (ApplicationFrameHost.exe) that loads payloads, while data.bin turned out to be a JPEG file. According to the challenge description, our task was to reverse data.bin and examine its contents.</p>

<p>The functionality that resides in <code>init_all()</code>, which gets called after this setup phase. This function would handle:
    <p>1.Application-specific memory transformations</p>
    <p>2.Core program operations</p></p>
