            <h1>Analysis of Ayushman Card Application (Scam_App)</h1>
            
            <section class="post-content">
                <p>When I returned from the exam, I noticed that someone had sent a random application in the WhatsApp group. This person had literally shared the app in all the groups. Later, I found out that their phone had been hacked. However, I was curious to see what was inside the 2MB application and how it worked.</p>

                <h2>Initial Investigation</h2>
                <p>Upon initial investigation, it flagged several viruses and trojans.</p>

                <h2>Code Analysis</h2>
                <p>The next step was to analyze its source code.</p>
                
                    <img src="image3.png" class="post-image">
                    <pre><code> android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS
  android.permission.SEND_SMS
  android.permission.READ_SMS</code></pre>

  <p>Hmm, that seems sus! Asking for permission to access SMS? Thatâ€™s a classic red flag! Always be cautious with apps that request such permissions. Better safe than sorry! </p>
<pre><code>android:exported="true"</code></pre>

<p>This makes the activity accessible from outside the app, allowing me to use ADB in the terminal to run this app</p>
<p>The AndroidManifest file helps us understand the overall app permissions, which serves as the basic starting point for the attack.</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes, I found an interesting piece of code that constitutes the entire program logic.</p>

                     <img src="image4.png" class="post-image">
                     <pre><code>SILENTKILLER333</code></pre>

                <p>Ah, this sweet code has the secret key not stored or obfuscated, making the developer seem careless. They should have at least stored it in a different parameter or obfuscated it to make it more difficult to access.
                    <pre><code class="language-java">Cipher.getInstance("DES") and SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("DES")</code></pre> indicate that the encryption uses the DES algorithm, which requires a key to decrypt. We have the key, but where is the data we want to crack? It's like getting the answer without having theq
                    questions
                </p>

                <p>Upon further investigation, I found the main activity in the code, which had a stored string</p>

            <pre><code>public static final String store_num = EncryptionUtils.decrypt("eUlTC2MiOnL0JoptgyHQbg==");</code></pre>

            <p>I wrote a python3 code to decrypt the encrypted string</p>

            <p>This hides the app icon and Sends a confirmation SMS ("Extreme Moderate App Installed!") to the phone number stored(the attacker number)</p>

            <p>This snippet listens for incoming SMS messages, extracts potential OTPs or codes, and forwards them to a predefined number <code>(f2102a)</code></p>
